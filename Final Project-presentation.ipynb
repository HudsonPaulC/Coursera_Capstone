    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In business people are always being asked to relocate to new cities. This can be an extremely stressful and overwhelming event for the individual being relocated. \n",
    "To help reduce this stress, it would be nice to help the individuals compare their current location to their new location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before smart phones, social media and the prevalence of machine learning algorithms, a person would have to rely on other peopleâ€™s suggestions or to have to read books about the new city they are going to. They may also choose to take some time to visit the new city. Since cities are big, it could take more than a week to visit all the neighborhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "They may already know that they want to move to a neighborhood that is very similar to their current neighborhood. However, some people like to try new things and they may want to find a neighborhood that is very different.\n",
    "It would be great if they could have the neighborhoods narrowed down to their desired needs. In our case we will assume the individual is being relocated from New York to Toronto.\n",

    "## Data Acquisition and Cleansing\t\n",
    "Venues Data\n",
    "We will use the Foursquaree venue data API to get the most frequented venues. Since this API requires the latitude and longtitude of the neighborhoods, we need to get this data from the following sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # New York Neighborhood Coordinates Data\n",
    "        We can use the publicly available dataset from  https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572\n",
    "\n",
    "    _# Toronto Neighborhood Coordinates Data_\n",
    "\t\n",
    "        We can use the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M that has a list of all the boroughs and neighborhoods in Toronto. \n",
    "        We will extract this list from an HTML table using beautiful soup. Unfortunately I was not able to get GEOCODE to work to get the latitude and longtitude of the \n",
    "        neighborhoods. I use the Geospatial Coordinates provide by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Cleansing & restrictions\n",
    "    The foursquare API limits the number of calls you can make per session. This forced me to reduce the number of neighborhoods used in the analysis. \n",
    "    I am going to use the Manhattan New York Borough and The Downtown-Toronto borough.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We removed any unassigned data from both datasets. The wikipedia HTML data set had new line characters that needed to be removed. Also I need to create the same column\n",
    "    names in the dataframes that held the New York and Toronto data\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Final Data Set\n",
    "    Once the data sets were prepared, I will concatenate both data sets into one neighborhood dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Feature Selection\n",
    "    The features for the different neighborhoods would be the 5 top most frequented venues for each neighborhood.  \n",
    "    I will use the mean frequency of visits to determine the to 5 venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\t\n",
    "    One way to compare cities is to use a venue-based similarity measure. For example, the person being relocated may require \n",
    "    that there are coffee shops, parks and restaurants all within walking distance in their neighborhood. \n",
    "     \n",
    "    In order to that, we would want to know what type of venues people are most frequently visited in a specific neighborhood. For example, \n",
    "    if people are going to parks a lot, then parks must be a strong attribute of the neighborhood. Conversely, if there is a coffee shop in \n",
    "    the neighborhood but it is not frequented as much,then coffee shops would not be an attribute of the neighborhood.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this project I will explore the use of incidentally generated social network data for the folksonomic characterization of cities by the type of amenities located \n",
    "    within them. Folksonomy is also known as collaborative tagging, social classification, social indexing, and social tagging.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In our example we will add the venue information in the individuals current New York neighborhoods to the venue information of the Toronto neighborhoods. \n",
    "    I will build 8 neighborhood clusters using the 10 top most frequently visited venues per neighborhood. I will use the mean frequency of visits to determine \n",
    "    the to 10 venues. I will run a k-means to cluster the neighborhood into 8 clusters. All Toronto neighborhoods that are in the same cluster as their New York\n",
    "    neighborhood would be considered similar. All other cluster would be dissimilar. We added other New York neighborhoods into the analysis since the person may\n",
    "    want a neighborhood that is like another New York neighborhood they wish to move into.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Clustering\n",
    "    \n",
    "    I will run a k-means to cluster the neighborhood into 8 clusters. All Toronto neighborhoods that are in the same cluster as their New York neighborhood would be \n",
    "    considered similar. All other cluster would be dissimilar. We added other New York neighborhoods into the analysis since the person may want a neighborhood that is \n",
    "    like another New York neighborhood they wish to move into.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Results\t\n",
    "    Cluster 1\n",
    "       This was all New York neighborhoods that was heavily Italian Restaurants and then fitness such as gyms and yoga\n",
    "       \n",
    "    Cluster 2\n",
    "       This was a single Toronto neighborhood that consisted of outdoor activities such as parks, trails and playgrounds\n",
    "       \n",
    "    Cluster 3\n",
    "       This was all Toronto neighborhoods that probably surround the airport since Airport terminal and airport lounge was all that wsa included\n",
    "       \n",
    "    Cluster 4\n",
    "       Mostly a New York cluster with one Toronto neighborhood. This was mainly cafe and hotels\n",
    "       \n",
    "    Cluster 5\n",
    "       Single Toronto neighborhood consisting of Cafes, Grocery Stores and parks\n",
    "       \n",
    "    Cluster 6\n",
    "       Single New York neighborhood consisting of bars, parks and ferry service\n",
    "       \n",
    "    Cluster 7 \n",
    "       A split of New York and Toronto neighborhoods with a variety of restaraunts as their main venues\n",
    "       \n",
    "    Cluster 8\n",
    "       A split of New York and Toronto neighborhoods with a heavy focus on cafes\n",
    "       \n",
    "## Discussion\t  \n",
    "    After reviewing my results, I am very surprised that there are some neighborhoods that are unique to the city\n",
    "    except for the Toronto neighborhoods that has or borders an airport.We know that Manhattan does not have any \n",
    "    Airports since they are across the river in Queens.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    You can see in Cluster 2 that there seems to be a single neighborhood more outdoor activities. It\n",
    "    must be on the outerpart of the city that borders a suburban type neigborhood. This makes sense\n",
    "    since Manhattan is bordered by other large cities such as Queens and the Bronx.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Cluster 5 seems more like residential area since it has grocery stores and parks that is unique\n",
    "    to Toronto\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Cluster 6 is a unique neighborhood that is focused heavily on the ferry with bars. This must\n",
    "    be the neighborhood where commuters are coming into,\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Cluster 7 & 8 are similiar to both Cities. They do contains a lot of neighborhoods in both cities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Conclusion\t  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The clustering did show that in general New York (Manhattan) and Toronto are very similiar when looking\n",
    "    at the top venues but also that they do have some unique neighborhoods. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    To improve the clusters I think you would want to bring in criminal activity data and housing data\n",
    "    such as median house price and types of housing. Also you could bring school data especially for\n",
    "    families that are being located.\n",
    "    \n",
